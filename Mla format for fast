  <h1>Web Practices</h1>
  <p>Web practices are very neccesary when it comes to coding on computers and having good web practices give everything you code a better and more professional look. Websites should have a nice looking color scheme with colors that compliment each other. There should not be too many colors used in a website so people should try to keep that number minimal. Should develop a clear idea on what the point of the website is. Define the objective of the website if that is not clear people will not come to the website. Put the most important content on the top of the page. Design with not a lot of white space put enough to give people's brains a break from color. Group cotent strategically and utitilize grid-based layouts. </p>
  <p>Find ways to help make sure that nobody gets lost on a website and make it very easy to navigate. Don't overload webpages with just text make it more interesting than just boring text on a screen so that people can enjoy the website. Make the design friendly to mobile so that people on phones can get acces to the websites. Make website speed fast so that users aren't taking forever on just trying to load a signle page. Compress file sizes on the website so that it goes faster. Make the website accesible by making it found easily and making sure it can be used easily. Tools on the website should be easy to use and understand and should be found easily. </p>
